The purpose of my project is to create a portfolio showcasing my work and skills so far, my website is comprised of 4 pages, the home page, about page, resume page and contact page.

Each page is built using a grid box with flex boxes inside of each defined section. The sections include the Header, Body, Sidebar and Footer. The pages are navigated via the buttons on the right hand side of the screen inside the Sidebar.

Some features I have include an image of myself, links to other pages and links to my Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub. All of these links have hover features which bring them to life as your mouse scrolls over them.

The target audience is currently the educators at Coder Academy for the purpose of this assignment, but in the future after some more work, I would love for it to be something I show potential employees to gain employment.
